	</ol>
	<h3>Voting Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>For the officer positions of Student Body President, Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, Student Body Chief of Staff, and all single-seat Senate races, the ballots shall be counted by the method of ranked choice voting if there are more than two (2) candidates. First-Past-The-Post voting “majority vote” will be used in that scenario</li>
		<li>Ranked Choice Voting counting procedure
			<ol>
				<li>The initial round of counting shall be a count of the first choices marked on each ballot. If any candidate receives a majority of the first choices, that candidate shall be declared the winner</li>
				<li>If no candidate receives a majority of first choices, there shall be a second round of counting.  The last-place candidate shall be eliminated, and all the continuing ballots shall be recounted.  Each continuing ballot shall be counted as one vote for that ballot’s highest ranked advancing candidate.</li>
				<li>If no candidate receives a majority at the second round of counting, there shall be a third round of counting, continuing in the manner prescribed above.</li>
				<li>The process of eliminating the last-place candidates and recounting all the continuing ballots shall continue until one candidate receives a majority of the votes in a round.  The candidate who receives a majority of the votes in a round shall be declared the winner, pending ratification.</li>
				<li>When a ballot does not list a preference for any given round, it shall not be counted in that round or any subsequent round.</li>
				<li>If there are not sufficient second and lower choices for any candidate to receive a majority, the candidate with the highest number of votes shall be declared the winner, pending ratification.</li>
				<li>When a ballot becomes an exhausted ballot, it shall not be counted in that round or any subsequent round for that position.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>For the officer positions of multi-seat senate races, the ballots shall be counted by the method of multi-winner ranked choice voting</li>
		<li>Multi-Winner Ranked Choice Voting procedures
			<ol>
				<li>The threshold for each multi-winner race is determined by using the number of open positions and adding one to that number to determine a denominating number. Then taking the total number of valid ballots cast and dividing by that denominating number. The resulting number is then increased by one.
					<ol>
						<li>((Total number of votes cast for that position)/(number of open positions + 1))+1</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Counting the ballot
					<ol>
						<li>The initial round of counting shall be a count of the first choices marked on each ballot. Any candidates who reaches the necessary threshold after the first round of counting are declared elected
							<ol>
								<li>A candidate elected in the initial round shall not receive any further ballots</li>
								<li>Any candidate reaching threshold shall not receive any more ballots</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>In the event that the initial round did not result in electing candidates to fill all open positions then the remaining positons shall be determined by the following:
							<ol>
								<li>Votes above the threshold for the elected candidates are redistributed to the candidates marked next in preference using surplus transfer (see that section).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>If, after transferring the surplus, a candidate’s votes rise to the threshold, that candidate is declared elected.</li>
						<li>Surplus transfer is repeated until all votes have been transferred.  If a position is still open, then the candidate that has the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their ballots are counted for the next indicated choice on their ballot. This process continues until no remaining candidates reach the threshold or the number of eliminated candidates precludes any further election.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Transferring the surplus
					<ol>
						<li>Ballots cast for candidates whom met threshold are sorted by pile, by the elected candidate.</li>
						<li>A surplus number is determined for each elected candidate by taking the total number of votes for that candidate and subtracting the threshold number.</li>
						<li>Using that surplus number, ballots are removed from that candidates stack and distributed to other candidates as follows:
							<ol>
								<li>Each pile is recounted to determine the number of next votes for any candidates not yet elected.</li>
								<li>Using those numbers, the remaining candidates are given a portion of the votes relative to the voting share reflected by the recount
									<ol>
										<li>(Next choice/total votes for that candidate) *surplus number</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Marking a ballot</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>For multi candidate races - voters are to rank their choices in order of preference – 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, and so on.</li>
		<li>To be valid, a ballot must be marked with sequential numbers</li>
	</ol>
