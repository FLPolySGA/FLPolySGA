<p><em><big><big><big><b>Title</b>: 06-05: Fall and Spring Class Amendment</big></big></big></em></p>

<p><em><big><big><big><b>Brief:</b> This bill will amend the Student Body constitution to create a fall and spring class. This will help the students because in the current system they vote in the spring for where they believe they will live in the fall and the same thought is used when voting for class representatives. Representatives will start their role if they are elected shortly after the election date.</big></big></big></em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em><big><big><big><b>Title</b> 06-06: Voting Method Amendment</big></big></big></em></p>

<p><em><big><big><big><b>Brief:</b> This bill will amend the Student Body constitution to remove the run-off election to be replaced with a voting method section. This will allow the student body to choose what method of voting they want to use for elections. Ranked Choice Voting or similar methods may be chosen for future elections.</big></big></big></em></p>
