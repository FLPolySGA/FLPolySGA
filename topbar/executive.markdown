## Agencies

### Campus Activities Board (CAB)

CAB consists of committees working together to plan and facilitate events throughout the course of the academic year, including summer terms. There is no membership requirement to join CAB and students can come to meetings at any time throughout the year. Students can participate as much as they would like in each committee. The goal of the Campus Activity Board is to foster the community culture of the student body of Florida Polytechnic University. As an Executive Agency, their authority comes from the Executive Branch of the Student Government Association who they will report to.

## Committees

### Safety Committee

The University Safety Committee Student Representative is the link between University safety services and the student body. It is their job to keep the Executive Board up to date on all construction projects and updates on campus, as well as any safety concerns such as the maintenance of Blue Light Boxes, IST power washing, and more. They also bring student safety concerns to the relevant University authorities so that those issues can be addressed in a timely manner.
