The Legislative Branch is comprised of senators represented by class years, degree programs, and on- and off-campus students. The Senate enacts statutes, allocates funds and oversees campus organizations. The Legislative Branch will grow as the University grows.

A major role of the ABC is to help Registered Student Organizations (RSO) receive funding by submitting a budget proposal and going through revisions which will then be passed on to Senate to see if there are any more revisions needed. The ABC is committed to helping students and RSOs receive funding through certain line items in the SGA Budget.
