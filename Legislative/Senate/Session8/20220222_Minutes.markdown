## Start Quorum
- Quorum Met

## Initial Motions
- A motion to approve this meeting’s agenda was made by Alex and seconded by Justin passed unanimously. 
- A motion to approve last meeting’s minutes was made by Ekar and seconded by Gustavo passed unanimously.  

## Topics for Discussion
- Decorum
  - During ABC yesterday, someone talked over Tristan
  - It’s been discussed before; do not talk over people and if the chair calls order, listen to him 
  - Also, if an item is tabled, discussion is dropped immediately 
  - If the discussion relates to an organization you’re a part of, you should exclude yourself from voting, as you are representing that club, not SGA at that moment (especially during PRs and budgets)
- Cooldown with SGA
  - Tomorrow, 12pm to 2pm
  - CapriSuns
  - Students can ask questions and talk to us 
  - Whoever is available in that time, please go to help (including set up at 11:30pm) 
  - Ask Judicial and Executive to come as well 
- Special Elections
  - In the past, had a problem with an Executive member graduating and not having a runner-up 
  - Idea: instead of special elections, just don’t allow people to accept office if they’re not able to fill the entire term 
  - Not forbid it, but have the information at hand could be good 
  - This policy could also help with the Senate missing a lot of chairs 
  - Elections need more awareness
  - What should be the timeline?
    - Some members said same as current elections 
    - Other members suggest a fast timeline, but most of the members disagree 
      - This was a 0.5 to 1 week election cycle for everything - campaing + application + voting
    - 1 week application, 1 week campaigning, 2 days of voting – final decision 
  - Pay for candidate flyers?
    - No; it is cheap to print flyers so it is not necessary
    - Will further discuss allowing candidates to submit posts to SGA social media
