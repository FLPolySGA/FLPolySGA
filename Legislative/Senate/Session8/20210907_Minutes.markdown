## Start Quorum
- Quorum Met

## Initial Motions

## Topics for Discussion
- Judicial Appointments – scheduled speaker, Jake 
  - Must be a supermajority of the senate 
  - List: 
    - Hailey Skoglund – Chief Justice 
    - Andre Archer – Associate Justice 
    - Mykell Spencer – Associate Justice 
    - Conner Murphy – Associate Justice 
  - Motion was made by Alex and seconded by Doug to confirm Hailey as Chief Justice. Passes unanimously. 
  - Motion was made by Benji and seconded by Breanne to confirm Andre Archer as an Associate Justice. Passes unanimously. 
  - Motion was made by Gustavo and seconded by Breanne to confirm Mykell Spencer as an Associate Justice. Passes unanimously. 
  - Motion was made by Alex and seconded by Doug to appoint Conner Murphy as an Associate Justice. Passes unanimously. 
- Unofficial Clubs – schedule speaker, Graham Gilbert 
  - Housing posted flyers for an unofficial club, calling themselves a club 
  - Any group can use the title of club, regardless of RSO status 
  - There has been some confusion since that title is also used for RSOs 
  - The idea was brought up to not allow them to use the work “club” to describe themselves 
    - Should we do this? 
      - Alex’s opinion (SOC Chair): No. It would be unenforceable.  
    - Alternative: 
      - Ask for them to change their advertisement from Club to trying to create a club. If they do not wish to become an RSO, then they would use club 
    - Jake (Greenberg) mentions this might be more trouble than it's worth, and as long as the posters have been properly approved, it should be fine. 
  - Decision: there is no reason to ban the word. However, if people claim to be official, then we can tell them not to and take steps then. We’ll also be modifying the wording in the SOC documents, so the word “club” is not mentioned. 
  - Apparently, Heather can approve posters without Jimmy’s approval. It is our understanding that all posters have to go through Jimmy, so we need to talk to Heather and Jimmy to solve this matter. 
  - The flyer mentioned was approved by Heather, but not Jimmy, therefore the confusion. 
- RSO Orientation and Connex Keys – scheduled speakers, Alex gage 
  - RSO Orientation 
    - Most likely will change date, since we have a big event the same day 
    - Jimmy reserved space 
    - Still have to communicate with presenters 
    - Will be moved to the 26th  
    - Lunch will be provided 
    - Starting at 10am, should take about 6 to 7 hours 
  - Connex Keys 
    - Alex got one from Jimmy 
    - The old Connex keys do not work; the lock has been changed 
- Snow Cones and Suggestions 
  - Benji finished the flyers (see meeting folder) 
  - It would promote the suggestion boxes 
  - Tent outside the IST, just like Tie Die day 
  - Have it also promote the Elections Committee 
  - Talk to dining today to get their machine 
  - Tuesday the 14th 
- Suggestion Boxes 
  - We already have suggestion boxes 
  - No one currently checks the boxes 
  - Who would like to take lead on this? 
    - Graham 
- Business Cards 
  - October 7th is career day 
  - Benji, Breanne, Catherine, and Charles cannot receive new business cards, as their positions are up for reelections
