The Audit and Budget Committee (ABC) deals with Student Governmentâ€™s funding. A major role of the ABC is to help Registered Student Organizations (RSO) receive funding by submitting a budget proposal and going through revisions which will then be passed on to Senate to see if there are any more revisions needed. The ABC is committed to helping students and RSOs receive funding through certain line items in the SGA Budget.
