The Legislative Executive Board (LEB) deals with overseeing general operations of the Senate and creating policy. A major role of the LEB is to conduct Senator accountability reports, discuss weekly committee updates, and ensure that the Senate is operating effectively. The LEB is comprised of five voting members: Senate President, Senate President Pro Tempore, Audit and Budget Committee Chair, Student Organizations Committee Chair, and Information and Communications Committee Chair.
