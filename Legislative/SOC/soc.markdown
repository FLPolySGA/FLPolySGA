The Student Organizations Committee (SOC) deals with student organizations and clubs. A major role of the SOC is to approve and manage Registered Student Organizations. Students may submit paperwork to apply for a new organization at any time, and the SOC will work with the students through the process. The SOC is here for the students and to help create a better, more active campus life.
